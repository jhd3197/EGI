# EGI Roadmap

This is the single source of truth for where EGI is going. Each plan is a self-contained document in [`docs/plans/`](plans/). Status is maintained by hand; update it when a phase ships.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-29 shipped: UX Audit & Pre-Flight Checks. Frontend: fixed the three known issues — `Wordmark.jsx` now renders "EGI" at one uniform size (no oversized "E"); the warm beige `#F4EFE7` app background is replaced by a neutral design token (`color.bg` = `#F8F9FA`, `#F1F3F5` sunken fills) via a new `frontend/src/styles/tokens.js`; `ShelterDetailScreen.jsx` "Desde otro lugar" now offers Usar-mi-ubicación / Elegir-en-el-mapa / Escribir-un-lugar (best-effort offline-degrading `geocodePlace` in `lib/directions.js`) with raw lat/lon demoted to a "Coordenadas (avanzado)" disclosure — primary Directions defaults to my location. Tokens adopted in Logo/ConnectionBanner too. Tooling: `npm run ux:audit` (no-dep i18n purity + WCAG contrast over tokens + offline self-containment → dated report under `docs/ux-audit/reports/`, gitignored), `scripts/ux-contrast.mjs` (advisory, `--strict` gates critical body-text pairs — all ≥9:1), `tests/a11y.test.js` (axe-style button-name/label rules, CI-gated under `npm test`), opt-in `ux:lighthouse`/`ux:axe`; CI `tests.yml` runs `ux:audit` after build. Docs: `docs/ux-audit/` (findings-001, baseline screenshot convention, `PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md` release gate linked from README + DEPLOYMENT, `USER_FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE.md`); in-app "Reportar un problema" in Settings (`lib/feedback.js`, offline mailto with non-personal screen/lang/version/device context, address overridable); CONTRIBUTING + project CLAUDE.md UX-pre-flight + design-token guidance. 808 es/en/pt keys (parity green), build + 131 vitest green, fresh-DB server boot + `/health`+`/shelters`+SPA-catch-all E2E verified. No native Android code changed; on-device PWA visual verification of these changes rides the pre-existing WebView TDZ (plans 19/27/28). Plan 29 is the last roadmap plan.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-28 shipped: Missing Animals (Pets) — a parallel pet registry that reuses the mesh but is never mixed with missing-person data. Server: `animals` table (migration 0013) + `AnimalRecord` with six animal statuses (CHECK + `VALID_ANIMAL_STATUSES`), `modules/animals.py` + `routes/animals.py` (`GET/POST /animals`, `GET /animals/{id}`, `PATCH /animals/{id}/status`, timestamp-guarded LWW, trust-gated public list), `/sync` carries an additive `animals` list both ways; shelter animal board (`list_shelter_animals`/`add_shelter_animal`, public `GET` + writer-gated `POST /shelters/{id}/animals`); `modules/animals_dedup.py` animal-only dedup (exact microchip/reporter+name+species, species-gated fuzzy reusing plan-27 phonetic+Levenshtein, operator-gated `/animals/duplicates` scan/auto-merge/merge/reject, soft reversible `merged_into` — never crosses into persons); trust/safety (owner-contact stripped from public reads + rate-limited `POST /animals/{id}/contact` reveal, flags action animal `reviewed` via the existing moderation flow). Frontend: `AnimalsScreen`/`AnimalReportSheet`/`AnimalDetailScreen` (filter chips, offline-queued report, reveal-contact, verified badge, flag via generalized `FlagModal`), store + `view.decorateAnimal`, AppShell/TabBar/Sidebar wiring, in-app "use the people form" note; Plan-24 unified preferences already gate animals (display tab+list, notify off by default, mesh relay) — `tests/animals.test.js` locks it; 792 shared es/en/pt keys (parity green), build + 116 vitest green. Android: `RecordEnvelope.TYPE_ANIMAL` + `AnimalEntity`/`AnimalDao` + `EgiDatabase` v3 (`MIGRATION_2_3`, schema `3.json`) + animal mappers + `MeshRepository.mergeAnimalEnvelope` (hop-limit/LWW/relay, `CATEGORY_ANIMALS` relay opt-out) + `CloudSyncClient`/`BluetoothMeshManager` animals upload/download + `AnimalEnvelopeTest`; assembleDebug + unit tests green, installed + launched on Samsung SM-S134DL + Moto G Play 2023 (clean v2→v3 migration, healthy mesh in logcat; PWA visual render rides the pre-existing WebView TDZ from plans 19/27). README + `docs/README.{en,es,pt}.md` "Missing Animals" sections. Server pytest green (366+ passing, no regression). Roadmap execution order is 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-27.5 shipped: Volunteer Coordination, Facility Access & Building Inspections. Server: `volunteer_profiles` registry table (migration `0011`, `modules/volunteers.py` + public `/volunteers/register|me|nearby|sync` — availability/mobility/skills, timestamp-guarded LWW, anonymous SAR join untouched); role "hats" on `sar_volunteers` (`role` column via `_migrate_table_columns`, `VolunteerJoin.role` + `PATCH /sar/volunteers/{id}/role`); facility watcher integration (`sar_facility_watch` table + migration `0012`, `facility_match` field-report type + verdicts, operator-gated `operations_near_facility`/`subscribe`/`facility-candidates`/`facility-match`, confirmed `person_is_here` updates the person via the existing resolve gate); building inspections (`building_inspection` field-report type + structured `checklist` column, unsafe/occupied/blocked/follow-up flags the sector `needs_recheck` on create + mesh sync). Frontend: intent-first HomeScreen (looking/help/facility cards, persisted), role picker + change-in-place + role chips in OperationDetailScreen/SectorCard, new `FacilityMatchScreen`, inspection checklist in `FieldReportSheet` + status-board badges, `lib/location.js` + `LocationSuggestions` proximity panel (opt-in, quiet-hours aware, offline) on Home/Operations. es/en/pt i18n (705 keys, parity green); frontend build + check:i18n + 112 vitest green; server pytest green; fresh-DB live HTTP E2E across all six phases verified; migrations clean. Android mesh transport of the new report types rides the existing `RecordEnvelope`/`merged_into` carry (no new native code this plan). Roadmap execution order is 28 → 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-27 shipped: Data Quality & Deduplication Engine. Server: exact dedup (`normalize_cedula`/`normalize_phone`, `exact_clusters`, operator `auto_merge_exact` + `GET /duplicates/exact` — soft/audited/reversible); fuzzy engine `modules/dedup.py` (hand-rolled Spanish/Portuguese phonetic key + Levenshtein + composite name/age/location/time scoring with reason codes), persisted `merge_candidates` table (additive, migration `0010`) + `/merge-candidates` scan/list/resolve; field-level `resolve_conflicts` (source-trust priority, newer-wins tie-break, losing values preserved) + `can_override_status` (found/deceased need a verified source); OCR/SMS drafts auto-scan into the candidate queue on creation; `merge_candidates` count added to `/stats/global`; `egi quality report` CLI. Frontend: `MergeReviewModal.jsx` (side-by-side, matching-green/conflict-amber, confidence/reason chips, provenance, merge/not-match/needs-info) + DuplicatesScreen candidate queue + store/view wiring + DashboardScreen widget, es/en/pt/guc i18n (parity green; build + check:i18n + 106 vitest green). Android: `DedupNormalize.kt` (server-mirrored exact keys, 11 JVM tests) + `MeshRepository.localExactDuplicates`; cloud/mesh merges converge via the existing `merged_into` LWW carry (assembleDebug + testDebugUnitTest green, installed on both phones). KNOWN ISSUE: the PWA-in-WebView white screen on both devices is a PRE-EXISTING React-vendor init-order (TDZ) defect in the bundled assets — reproduced on committed main, independent of plan-27 — so the new UI is verified by build/vitest/i18n but not yet on-device; native mesh stack healthy in logcat. Roadmap execution order is 28 → 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-26 shipped: SAR Operations Workflow. Server: six additive `sar_*` tables + migration `0009`, `modules/sar.py` + `routes/sar.py` — operation CRUD with auto-grid/manual sectors + persons M2M, sector claim/release/status with one-active-volunteer-per-sector 409 conflict, volunteer join/check-in/check-out, per-sector task checklist, field reports (`sighting`→`needs_recheck`, `cleared`, `needs_help`, `found`) with the `found`→registry status update gated on operator confirmation, `/sar/sync` mesh/cloud last-write-wins; namespaced under `/sar` so it never collides with the plan-09 `/operations` (events) surface; public reads + anonymous volunteer actions, verified-account operation creation, operator-gated `found` confirmation, every mutation audit-logged. Frontend: `OperationsScreen`/`OperationDetailScreen`/`SectorCard`/`FieldReportSheet` (offline-queued) + store/view wiring (`'operations'` category-gated tab, 409 handling, `myVolunteer` tracking) + DashboardScreen SAR widgets, trilingual es/en/pt (629 keys, parity green; build + check:i18n green). Android: `RecordEnvelope.TYPE_FIELD_REPORT` mesh transport + relay passthrough + JVM round-trip test (assembleDebug + testDebugUnitTest green); on-device Room persistence of relayed field reports rides the pending Room-migration/BLE-cert path like plan-25's trust carry. 13 server pytest + 5 frontend vitest; full server + frontend suites green; live HTTP E2E (create→join→claim→check-in→found→confirm→registry flip) verified. Roadmap execution order is 27 → 28 → 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-25 shipped: Trust, Safety & Verification. Server: record trust signals (`author_role`/`org_id`/`location_id`/`signature`) + server-computed `trust_tier` (`modules/trust.py`, never client-trusted), `device_reputation` (0-100 score/tier + ban/blocklist), `organizations`/`locations`/`org_members`/`location_watchers` with TOFU-pinned signing keys + operator verification, one-time `trust_invites` (link/QR, SHA-256, user-bound redeem), `moderation_flags` (public+offline+critical-first) + resolve, `moderators` onboarding + region-scoped queue, per-device/user rate limiting wired into `/sync` — migration 0008, routes `trust`/`organizations`/`locations`/`moderators` + `/flags`, CLI `egi device` + `egi moderation`. Frontend: trust badges, `FlagModal`, ModerationScreen Flags tab, `ModeratorOnboardingScreen`, `OrgAdminScreen` (548 i18n keys, parity green; build green). Android: `MeshCrypto` ECDSA sign/verify + envelope codec preserves trust fields on relay (store-and-forward Room carry partial). Docs: README trust section + SECURITY_CHECKLIST trust model. Server pytest green (pre-existing voice-backend env tests aside). Roadmap execution order is 26 → 27 → 28 → 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (plan-24 shipped: User Preferences, Subscriptions & Alerts — the unified cross-cutting layer. Server: `user_preferences`/`user_settings`/`operation_subscriptions` tables (migration 0006), `modules/preferences.py` (timestamp-guarded LWW + decision helpers), `modules/notifications.py` (preference-aware gate: category notify toggle, operation mute, near-me radius, quiet hours; critical categories + own-record matches bypass), `modules/subscriptions.py`, routes `/preferences[/categories|/notify-test]` + `/subscriptions` + `/operations/{id}/subscribe|unsubscribe|mute`; rate-limited + audited. Frontend: `lib/preferences.js`, local-first store sync, `SettingsScreen`+`NotificationSettings`, category-display gating in `view.js` (feed/search/map/shelters tab + near-me radius), `CategoryFilterNote`, DisasterPicker subscribe/mute. Android: per-category relay opt-outs gate the mesh bloom filter (`MeshRepository`/`BluetoothMeshManager`/`EgiBridge`) + PWA "data types I share" mesh section. Trilingual es/en/pt (498 keys, parity green); FE 101 tests green; assembleDebug runs on Samsung SM-S134DL. Roadmap execution order is 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28 → 29.)

**Previously updated:** 2026-06-28 (created Plan 24 — User Preferences, Subscriptions & Alerts as a unified cross-cutting layer; the animal opt-out in Plan 28 is now one application of this system. Roadmap execution order is 23 → 24 → 25 → 26 → 27 → 28 → 29.)

---

## Plan 11 — Communications Hub: SMS, Push, Email & Alerts
**File:** [`plans/plan-11-communications-hub.md`](plans/plan-11-communications-hub.md)  
**Goal:** Build a unified messaging layer for notifications, broadcasts, and two-way replies.

- ✅ Email provider abstraction (`modules/email.py` + `providers.py`: log/SMTP; welcome + password-reset (`/auth/forgot-password`, `/auth/reset-password`) + alert emails, es/en/pt HTML+text templates)
- ✅ Web Push + FCM push notifications (`modules/push.py`, `routes/push.py`, `frontend/public/sw.js` + `PushToggle`; subscribe/unsubscribe + operation topics) + native Android FCM client (`MeshFirebaseMessagingService`, plan-16). 🚧 Real delivery needs VAPID/FCM creds (`pywebpush`/`firebase-admin` optional, see `docs/PUSH_SETUP.md`).
- ✅ Operation-wide alert broadcasts (`modules/alerts.py`: `POST /operations/{id}/alerts` → push+SMS+email, templated with variables)
- ✅ Delivery status tracking (`messages` table + `alert_id`; `GET /messages`, `/operations/{id}/alerts`, `/alerts/{id}/messages`, status callback)

**Shipped in this plan:** `message_providers` / `messages` / `push_subscriptions` / `password_resets` tables; `modules/{messaging,providers,templates,email,push,alerts}.py`; routes `{messaging,push,alerts}` + SMS/auth extensions; pluggable provider abstraction (config = runtime change). **Remaining:** wire real provider credentials in a deployment and install `pywebpush`/`firebase-admin` for live Web Push/FCM (the native Android FCM client shipped in plan-16).

---

## Plan 12 — Interoperability, Federation & Data Exchange
**File:** [`plans/plan-12-interoperability-federation.md`](plans/plan-12-interoperability-federation.md)  
**Goal:** Import/export standard formats, federate trusted servers, and notify external systems.

- ✅ PFIF 1.4 XML round-trip (`server/pfif.py` export/import wired)
- ✅ CSV/Excel import and export (`modules/exchange.py` + `routes/exchange.py`: operator-gated CSV/xlsx export with filters, bulk import with es/en column-alias mapping + per-row validation; imports land as `source='csv_import'` awaiting moderation)
- ✅ PDF missing-person flyers (`modules/flyer.py` + `GET /persons/{id}/flyer.pdf`: localized es/en/pt, contact QR, optional photo behind `ENABLE_PHOTOS`; degrades to 503 if reportlab/qrcode absent)
- ✅ Webhooks with retry logic (`modules/webhooks.py` + `routes/webhooks.py`: subscription CRUD, HMAC-SHA256 signed delivery, per-attempt log, exponential-backoff `retry_pending`; emits `person.created/updated/merged` + `operation.closed`, best-effort post-commit)
- ✅ Server-to-server federation (`modules/federation.py` + `routes/federation.py` + `egi peer` CLI: `trusted_peers` with TOFU public-key pinning, pull/push/sync reusing the `/sync` last-write-wins logic so two nodes federate without duplicates)

## Plan 13 — Operational Intelligence, Dashboards & Reporting
**File:** [`plans/plan-13-operational-intelligence.md`](plans/plan-13-operational-intelligence.md)  
**Goal:** Give commanders situational awareness through dashboards, quality scoring, and reports.

- ✅ Operation and global stats endpoints (`modules/stats.py` + `routes/stats.py`: `GET /stats/operations/{id}`, `/stats/operations/{id}/timeseries`, `/stats/global`)
- ✅ Data-quality scoring (`modules/quality.py` + `routes/quality.py`: per-record completeness/confidence/freshness score with issue codes, cached in `data_quality_scores`; `/quality/summary|low|stale|persons/{id}|recalculate`; `egi quality-scan` nightly job)
- ✅ Automated duplicate suggestions (`modules/duplicates.py`; surfaced in `egi quality-scan` + `possible_duplicate` quality flag)
- ✅ Heatmap and hot-zone endpoints (`GET /operations/{id}/heatmap` + `/bounds`, shipped in plan-10; suggested search sectors added in plan-13: `GET /operations/{id}/sectors`)
- ✅ Scheduled SITREP reports (`modules/sitrep.py` json/html/pdf + `modules/scheduled_reports.py` + `routes/reports.py`: `GET /operations/{id}/sitrep`, `scheduled_reports` CRUD, `POST /reports/run-due`; `egi sitrep` + `egi run-reports` CLIs; PDF degrades to 503 without reportlab)
- ✅ PWA dashboard screen (`frontend/src/components/DashboardScreen.jsx`, operator-gated, consumes `/stats`)

## Plan 14 — Inclusive Crisis Access: Voice, Chatbots, Translation & Low-Literacy UX
**File:** [`plans/plan-14-inclusive-crisis-access.md`](plans/plan-14-inclusive-crisis-access.md)  
**Goal:** Lower the barriers to reporting and searching so almost anyone can use EGI during a crisis, regardless of literacy, language, device, or connectivity.

- ✅ WhatsApp bot for reporting and search (`modules/chatbot.py` + `modules/whatsapp_bot.py`, `POST /webhooks/whatsapp`; Twilio + Meta Cloud API drivers, `log` default; report/safe/search FSM, drafts `source='whatsapp'` reviewed=0 → moderation; replies logged in `messages`)
- ✅ Telegram bot for diaspora volunteers (`modules/telegram_bot.py`, `POST /webhooks/telegram`; `/buscar /reportar /estoybien /ayuda`, reuses the same engine; slash commands reset in-progress intent)
- ✅ Voice-note transcription (`modules/voice.py` + `voice_transcripts` table, `POST /voice/transcribe`): local-first Whisper backends, best-effort WhatsApp/Telegram audio download, low-confidence flagged for confirmation; on-device (Web Speech API / EgiNative) preferred. 🚧 Server backend needs optional `faster-whisper`.
- ✅ On-device translation + Wayuu (`frontend/src/i18n/guc.js` partial dict + offline `LanguagePicker`, `lib/translate.js` EgiNative bridge). 🚧 Native Android ML Kit offline packs are a direction doc (`mobile/android/translation-plan14.md`), not yet shipped in Kotlin.
- ✅ Panic/low-literacy UI mode (`SimpleHomeScreen.jsx`: three giant high-contrast actions, tap-to-hear TTS via `lib/speech.js`, `simpleMode` persisted)
- ✅ Printable shelter posters with QR codes (`modules/poster.py`, `GET /operations/{id}/poster.pdf`: big QR opens the PWA with `?op=<id>`, pictographic steps, es/en/pt; 503 without reportlab/qrcode)

---

## Plan 15 — Production Operations, Observability & Scaling
**File:** [`plans/plan-15-production-operations-observability-scaling.md`](plans/plan-15-production-operations-observability-scaling.md)  
**Goal:** Make EGI reliable, observable, and scalable enough for real-world community deployment.

- ✅ Structured `/health`, `/ready`, and Prometheus `/metrics` (`modules/health.py`, `metrics.py`; hand-rolled exposition, no new deps; request middleware records count+latency, DB-derived gauges)
- ✅ Structured JSON logs with request IDs (`logging_config.py`: JSON/text formatter + `request_id` contextvar, `X-Request-ID` echo/generate, structured access log) + consolidated operator-gated `GET /audit/log` (`routes/audit.py`)
- ✅ Automated encrypted backups + restore CLI + offsite upload (`backup.py`: integrity check, retention pruning, Fernet encryption, S3 via boto3 — both optional/graceful; `egi backup --retention-days/--encrypt/--s3-*`, `egi schedule-backup`, `egi restore` decrypts + verifies; restore drill in `docs/OPERATIONS.md`)
- 🚧 PostgreSQL migration path with a migration runner — runner shipped & CI-enforced (`migrate.py`, `server/migrations/*.sql`, `schema_migrations`, `egi migrate [--check]`); `DATABASE_URL` detection + `egi sqlite-to-postgres` cutover (`migrate_pg.py`, psycopg optional) + `docs/POSTGRES.md`. **Postgres runtime is experimental:** a few modules still use SQLite-only SQL (`INSERT OR REPLACE`, `PRAGMA`); SQLite remains the tested default.
- ✅ Load tests and documented SLOs (`docs/PERFORMANCE.md` SLOs, `server/tests/load/locustfile.py`, `frontend/tests/perf/lighthouserc.js`; TTL-cached global dashboard stats)
- ✅ Security/dependency scanning in CI (`.github/workflows/security.yml`: pip-audit + npm audit advisory, bandit blocking on HIGH, gitleaks, optional trivy; `.pre-commit-config.yaml`; `egi rotate-secrets`)
- ✅ Operations manual (`docs/OPERATIONS.md`) and example alerts (`deploy/prometheus-alerts.yml`, `deploy/docker-compose.staging.yml`, `egi deploy-staging`)

**Shipped in this plan:** `schema_migrations` + `system_events` tables; `server/{version,metrics,logging_config,migrate,migrate_pg}.py`; `modules/{health,system_events}.py`; `routes/{audit,system}.py`; backup encryption/retention/S3 + `egi {schedule-backup,migrate,sqlite-to-postgres,rotate-secrets,deploy-staging}`; CI security workflow + pre-commit; `docs/{OPERATIONS,PERFORMANCE,POSTGRES}.md` + `deploy/`. **Remaining:** finish Postgres runtime portability (raw-SQL dialect layer, psycopg connection in `db.get_db`, Postgres CI job).

## Plan 16 — Field-Ready Android Mesh & Native Communications
**File:** [`plans/plan-16-field-ready-android-mesh-and-native-comms.md`](plans/plan-16-field-ready-android-mesh-and-native-comms.md)  
**Goal:** Finish the Android mesh and native messaging bridge so EGI works offline between nearby phones and syncs the moment any device gets connectivity.

- ✅ Reports (PFIF notes) over BLE mesh (`MeshRepository.localRecordIndex/envelopesFor/mergeEnvelope` dispatch person+report; reports upload via `CloudSyncClient`)
- ✅ Live mesh UI in the PWA (`MeshScreen.jsx`: toggle+consent, peer count, last sync, queued, manual sync, status text, and recently-seen device list from `peer_synced` events)
- ✅ Wi-Fi Direct bulk socket transfer (`WifiDirectManager.sendBulk` ServerSocket/8988 + length-prefixed `ChunkFraming`; `BulkTransferTest`). 🚧 P2P group-owner negotiation auto-trigger in `BluetoothMeshManager` is still a TODO (device-level fallback)
- ✅ Relay duty-cycling + foreground service (`DutyCycler` advertise/scan/sleep + battery-saver + auto-low-battery + per-cycle logging; `MeshForegroundService` ongoing notification)
- ✅ SMS text-only check-in full flow (Android `SmsCheckinReceiver` creates linked person+report and nudges sync; server `POST /sms/webhook` mirrors it + outbound confirmation; lands reviewed=0 in moderation)
- ✅ Native Android FCM client (`MeshFirebaseMessagingService` → `POST /push/subscribe` kind=fcm, alerts forwarded to PWA) + optional server `firebase-admin`/`pywebpush` paths + `docs/PUSH_SETUP.md`. 🚧 Live delivery needs real VAPID/FCM creds (`google-services.json`)
- ✅ Warning-free Kotlin build + real Room migrations (deprecated `optString`/`GATT_SUCCESS`/`onBackPressed` already fixed; explicit `MIGRATION_1_2` + exported schemas + `MigrationTest`). ⚠️ assembleDebug not run here — no Android SDK in this environment
- 🚧 Android emulator/instrumented tests in CI + manual BLE certification — `.github/workflows/android.yml` (JVM `test` + emulator `connectedCheck`) and new instrumented tests added; manual BLE certification checklist in `docs/TESTING.md` + `mobile/android/scripts/` automation, but real-device sign-off is still pending hardware

## Plan 17 — Final Polish & Platform Finishes
**File:** [`plans/plan-17-final-polish-and-platform-finishes.md`](plans/plan-17-final-polish-and-platform-finishes.md)  
**Goal:** Clear the remaining cross-cutting 🚧 items and finish the product.

- ⏳ Event + city selectors in PWA (`DisasterPicker.jsx` city-within-event)
- ⏳ OCR review TUI helper (`egi ocr-review`)
- ⏳ Draw-a-box search tool in the map UI
- ⏳ Face-blur toggle for public-safe thumbnails
- ⏳ Server voice backend with optional `faster-whisper`
- ⏳ Native Android ML Kit offline translation packs
- ⏳ Full PostgreSQL runtime support + CI job

---

## Plan 18 — Android Automation & Validation Agent
**File:** [`plans/plan-18-android-automation-validation-agent.md`](plans/plan-18-android-automation-validation-agent.md)  
**Goal:** Make Android validation repeatable and agent-driven via ADB.

- ✅ Environment detection script (`scripts/detect-env.sh`) sets `JAVA_HOME` and `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT`
- ✅ Lint errors fixed and `lintDebug` passes
- ✅ Room schema JSONs exported (`app/schemas/1.json`, `2.json`) so `MigrationTest` passes
- ✅ `scripts/devices.py` lists connected devices, models, and EGI install state
- ✅ `scripts/install-and-configure.sh` builds APK, installs, grants permissions, and captures launch screenshots
- ✅ `scripts/run-tests.sh` runs lint + unit tests + instrumented tests on attached devices
- 🚧 `scripts/mesh-smoke-test.py` scaffolded for two-device BLE record exchange validation
- ⏳ CI workflow for Android + real-device self-hosted runner

---

## Plan 19 — PWA-in-WebView End-to-End Testing
**File:** [`plans/plan-19-pwa-webview-end-to-end-testing.md`](plans/plan-19-pwa-webview-end-to-end-testing.md)  
**Goal:** Make the embedded PWA fully usable offline and validate critical journeys on real hardware via ADB.

- ✅ PWA renders inside `WebViewAssetLoader` on Samsung and Moto test devices
- ✅ Bundle fonts into the PWA so the UI is identical offline — IBM Plex self-hosted via `@fontsource`, Google Fonts CDN removed, `npm run check:offline` guards against regressions (verified: no font-CDN requests on either device)
- ✅ Intercept `/sync` (and `/persons`, `/persons/{id}/reports`, `/favicon.ico`) so they are served from the native Room DB instead of failing with `ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` — `PwaApiBridge` (GET reads in `shouldInterceptRequest`; POST writes via `window.EgiNative` + a document-start fetch shim). Verified: `fetchAll` succeeds on both devices, no errors
- ✅ `scripts/pwa-smoke-test.sh` automates guest entry, alias entry, and report creation by driving the real DOM over CDP (`pwa_cdp.py` + `pwa-test-harness.js`) — all three journeys PASS on both devices; Journey C proves a UI-created report lands in Room
- ✅ Baseline screenshot comparison for visual regression — perceptual diff (`pwa_visual.py`), opt-in `EGI_VISUAL=1`, `update-baselines.sh`, per-device baselines (uncommitted)
- 🚧 Two-device mesh validation (`mesh-pwa-e2e-test.py`) — advertise-refresh fix shipped & verified (a PWA-created record now enters the mesh bloom; receiver discovers the peer), but end-to-end BLE propagation is blocked by Android's sub-second scan-window throttle; duty-cycle retuning tracked for plan-18
- ✅ Hands-free permission & consent dialogs (`device_dialogs.py`) — `grant_all()` pm-grants every dangerous permission before launch so the system dialog never appears; `accept_dialogs()` taps Allow/Permitir/Continuar via the `uiautomator` UI tree (clickable buttons only). Wired into `install-and-configure.sh` and the smoke/mesh runners → zero manual taps after install. Verified: consent dialog auto-dismissed on hardware
- ✅ CI: `android-pwa-smoke.yml` (emulator single-device journeys on every PR) + `android-mesh-e2e.yml` (self-hosted two-device, manual/nightly); `TESTING.md` documents the whole stack

---

## Plan 20 — Shelter & Refugee Information Hub
**File:** [`plans/plan-20-shelter-refugee-information-hub.md`](plans/plan-20-shelter-refugee-information-hub.md)  
**Goal:** Turn the current shelter list into a full information hub for victims, responders, and family members.

- ✅ Shelter detail card with capacity, services, contact, and supply needs (`ShelterDetailScreen.jsx`; server `shelters` table + `GET/POST /shelters`)
- ✅ "How to get there" directions from current location or any origin (`lib/directions.js` + native `EgiBridge.openTurnByTurn` Google Maps/Waze/OsmAnd intent; straight-line distance/time + cached route)
- ✅ Official shelter feed / updates from verified staff (`shelter_updates` + `GET/POST /shelters/{id}/updates`; official/volunteer/system role badges, occupancy side-effects, offline queue)
- ✅ "I am here" shelter check-in flow (`shelter_checkins` + `POST /shelters/{id}/checkin`, public family alias search `GET /shelters/checkins/search`, offline queue)
- ✅ Verified shelter operator mode + token management (`shelter_tokens`; commander `egi shelter issue-token/tokens/revoke-token`, `POST /shelters/claim` → trust=official, private roster + CSV export)

**Shipped in this plan:** four additive server tables (`shelters`/`shelter_updates`/`shelter_checkins`/`shelter_tokens`), `modules/shelters.py` + `routes/shelters.py` (filters has_space/accepts_pets/has_medical/needs_supplies, capacity PATCH, feed, check-in, claim, roster CSV); PWA `ShelterDetailScreen.jsx` + tap-through/filters/operator-claim in `SheltersScreen.jsx`, `lib/directions.js`; `egi shelter` CLI; es/en/pt i18n (guc falls back to es); 9 server + 6 frontend tests. **Remaining:** mesh propagation of shelter updates between phones (rides on the BLE certification still pending in plan-16/18); native Android operator UI (PWA covers it today); roster PDF (CSV ships, PDF deferred to the flyer/reportlab path).

---

## Plan 21 — Offline Routing: From X to Y
**File:** [`plans/plan-21-offline-routing-x-to-y.md`](plans/plan-21-offline-routing-x-to-y.md)  
**Goal:** Provide offline-capable directions between any two points relevant to EGI users (shelters, people, hazards, evacuation corridors).

- ✅ Basic directions UI with straight-line distance + walking time (`DirectionsScreen.jsx`; Haversine + bearing/cardinal step list, mi/km, 20-route IndexedDB history; es/en/pt/guc)
- ✅ Cached road-network routing packs + Web Worker graph search (`routing_packs` table + public `GET /routing/packs[/{id}]`; `routeGraph.js` A\* in `workers/routeWorker.js`, `routePack.js` IndexedDB cache; road polyline on the map; La Guaira demo pack seeded)
- ✅ Native Android turn-by-turn bridge (`EgiBridge.getCurrentPosition`/`navigateTo` + `LocationCache.kt` last-known cache + WebView geolocation grant; `openTurnByTurn` intent chain pre-existed; verified on SM-S134DL + Moto G Play)
- ✅ Hazard-aware routing (`hazard_zones` table + public `GET /hazards` / community `POST /hazards`→moderation + operator review; A\* edge avoidance via `hazards.js`; map overlays + route-crosses-hazard warning + "report hazard here")
- ✅ Route sharing over mesh (`route_shares` table + `POST /routes/share` 6h-dedup + `GET /routes/shared`; share + suggested-routes UI, offline-queued). 🚧 BLE-direct propagation rides on the device BLE certification still pending in plan-16/18; today shares sync via the server bridge-node path.
- ✅ Multi-modal and long-distance evacuation routing (`multimodal.js` walk/drive/transit speeds, arrival ranges, long-walk battery warning, `hubToHub` two-leg plan; `evacuation_corridors` table + `GET /corridors` + map overlay). 🚧 Public transit awaits a real GTFS/operator feed (degrades to a "no transit data" state).

---

## Plan 22 — i18n Language Purity Audit & Fix
**File:** [`plans/plan-22-i18n-language-purity-audit.md`](plans/plan-22-i18n-language-purity-audit.md)  
**Goal:** Remove mixed-language UI so Spanish shows only Spanish, English only English, and Portuguese only Portuguese.

- ✅ Audit and catalog every bilingual string and `*En` key
- ✅ Remove bilingual subtitles from `HomeScreen.jsx` and `ReportSheet.jsx` (+ single-`label` `typeDefs` in `view.js`)
- ✅ Purify `es.js`, `en.js`, and `pt.js` dictionaries (8 `*En` keys removed from each; all bilingual ` · ` halves stripped; pt Spanish leaks fixed; 443 identical keys)
- ✅ Add CI check that blocks ` · ` separators and `*En` keys (`frontend/scripts/i18n-check.js` → `npm run check:i18n`, wired into `tests.yml`)
- 🚧 Language-specific regression check shipped as a runtime vitest suite (`tests/i18n.test.js`, +5 purity tests); on-device screenshot baselines deferred (text purity is enforced at the dictionary level where the strings originate)

**Shipped in this plan:** the bilingual "Spanish · English" UI pattern is gone — components render one language per element, the three full dictionaries are monolingual with identical 443-key sets (the only remaining middots are legitimate single-language separators on an 11-key allowlist), and both a CI script (`check:i18n`) and a vitest suite block regressions. **Remaining:** optional on-device screenshot baselines per language (es/en/pt); `guc.js` stays intentionally partial and falls back to es.

---

## Plan 23 — Android Mesh Human Chain & Gateway Bridging
**File:** [`plans/plan-23-android-mesh-human-chain.md`](plans/plan-23-android-mesh-human-chain.md)  
**Goal:** Turn the Bluetooth mesh into a true human-chain relay where records hop across offline Android phones until they reach a gateway with internet.

- ✅ Hop limit (`BleConstants.MAX_HOPS=10`): `MeshRepository` rejects over-limit envelopes, withholds maxed-out records from the advertised index, and counts drops (`MeshRepositoryHopLimitTest`).
- ✅ Gateway flag in BLE advertisements — advert service data is now `[version][flags][bloom]`; the gateway bit is set from a 5-min cloud-reachability window (cleared after repeated failures or on stop), parsed onto `PeerDevice.isGateway` with legacy back-compat (`AdvertData` + `AdvertDataTest`).
- ✅ Gateway-aware connection prioritization — `shouldConnect()` prefers gateway peers (shorter cooldown) when local records are pending for the cloud; gateway upload path covered by `MeshChainTest`.
- ✅ Persistent live notification mirroring the PWA top-bar status (peers, queued, gateway/online state) with a "Sincronizar ahora" action; the PWA toggle now starts the foreground service so relaying survives backgrounding.
- ✅ Wi-Fi Direct bulk transfer — `WifiDirectManager` group negotiation (`awaitConnectionInfo`/`runBulkExchange`) wired into `syncBulkRound` with BLE fallback; real socket transfer verified over loopback (`WifiDirectBulkTransferTest`). 🚧 On-device P2P group-owner negotiation still needs paired-device certification.
- ✅ README update explaining the human-chain model (store-and-forward, gateways, ASCII diagram, limits, Android-only/iOS limitation, privacy) in the root README + es/en/pt copies.
- 🚧 Multi-device real-hardware human-chain certification (3-hop relay, return path, battery benchmark) — checklist + battery procedure shipped in `docs/TESTING.md`; rides on the BLE radio certification still pending in plan-16/18.

**Shipped in this plan:** anti-circulation hop limit; gateway discovery + preference routing; a live foreground-service notification as the default mesh path; completed Wi-Fi Direct bulk socket transfer; a PWA mesh screen that shows whether you are a gateway / a gateway is nearby + a hop-limit hint; trilingual README mesh explainer; new JVM (`AdvertDataTest`, `BulkTransferTest` merge) + instrumented (`MeshRepositoryHopLimitTest`, `MeshChainTest`, `WifiDirectBulkTransferTest`) tests. **Remaining:** real-device 3-hop chain sign-off + battery numbers; on-device Wi-Fi Direct group negotiation. **iOS mesh stays explicitly out of scope** (background BLE restrictions, documented).

---

## Plan 24 — User Preferences, Subscriptions & Alerts
**File:** [`plans/plan-24-user-preferences-subscriptions-alerts.md`](plans/plan-24-user-preferences-subscriptions-alerts.md)  
**Goal:** Let users control what they see, what notifies them, and what they relay over the mesh, so EGI does not overwhelm people with information they do not need.

- ✅ Preference data model and local-first storage with server sync (`user_preferences`/`user_settings` + migration 0006, `modules/preferences.py`, `lib/preferences.js`, IndexedDB-first store with timestamp-guarded LWW sync).
- ✅ Settings UI for per-category display/notify/relay toggles (`SettingsScreen.jsx` + `NotificationSettings.jsx`: category grid, near-me radius, quiet hours, batch digest, test-notification; trilingual).
- ✅ Apply preferences to PWA UI, search, map, and notifications (`view.js` gates feed/search/map/shelters tab + near-me radius, `CategoryFilterNote` indicator; server `modules/notifications.py` gate before push fan-out).
- ✅ Apply preferences to mesh relay (Bluetooth bloom filter) (Android per-category relay opt-outs exclude records from the advertised bloom + index served to peers; received-but-disabled records still stored/shown; PWA mesh share-types section).
- ✅ Operation and disaster-specific subscriptions (`modules/subscriptions.py`, `/operations/{id}/subscribe|unsubscribe|mute` + `/subscriptions`, auto-subscribe on report submit, DisasterPicker follow/mute controls).
- ✅ Abuse guardrails: critical alerts bypass toggles; preference changes are auditable (`notify_own_record_match` life-safety bypass, `life_safety` broadcast override, rate-limited + audit-logged preference/subscription writes).

**Why it sits here:** Preferences touch the mesh (Plan 23), notifications (Plan 11), and every future module (animals, hazards, SAR). Building the unified layer before trust/operations/deduplication means later plans only register a new category instead of reimplementing opt-out logic.

---

## Plan 25 — Trust, Safety & Verification
**File:** [`plans/plan-25-trust-safety-verification.md`](plans/plan-25-trust-safety-verification.md)  
**Goal:** Build a trust and verification layer that supports local watchers at hospitals/shelters, remote diaspora moderators, and authorized devices whose trust spreads through the mesh.

- ✅ Identity tiers and device reputation (record trust signals `author_role`/`org_id`/`location_id`/`signature` + server-computed `trust_tier` in `modules/trust.py`; `device_reputation` table/module with 0-100 score + tier; trust badges in PWA `PersonDetail`/`SearchScreen`; migration 0008).
- ✅ Organization and location authorization with QR-code invites (`modules/{organizations,locations,invites}.py` + routes; TOFU-pinned org signing keys, operator verification, watcher authorization; one-time SHA-256 invite links/`claim_url` for QR; user-bound `POST /trust/invites/redeem`; PWA `OrgAdminScreen`).
- ✅ Moderation queue for flagged reports and shelter updates (`moderation_flags` table; public+rate-limited+offline-queued `POST /flags`, operator `GET /flags(+stats)` and resolve; 'deceased' critical-first; flags ding device reputation; PWA `FlagModal` + ModerationScreen Flags tab).
- ✅ Remote moderator onboarding for diaspora volunteers (`moderators` table + `modules/moderators.py`; `/moderators/signup|me|me/trained|me/queue`, region-scoped queue, roster + digest; PWA `ModeratorOnboardingScreen`).
- ✅ Abuse prevention: rate limiting, device bans, audit log (`modules/rate_limit.py` per-device/user caps wired into `/sync`; commander device ban + blocklist bundle `GET /trust/blocklist` enforced in sync + search; every action audited; CLI `egi device ban|unban|list` + `egi moderation stats|flags`).
- 🚧 Android mesh trust carry: `MeshCrypto` ECDSA sign/verify shipped + the envelope codec preserves trust fields verbatim on direct relay, but `PersonEntity` lacks Room columns so store-and-forward drops `author_role`/`org_id`/`location_id`/`signature` until a Room migration; the cloud recomputes `trust_tier` authoritatively on the next gateway sync. Real-device BLE certification rides the pending mesh sign-off (plan-16/18/23).

---

## Plan 26 — SAR Operations Workflow
**File:** [`plans/plan-26-sar-operations-workflow.md`](plans/plan-26-sar-operations-workflow.md)  
**Goal:** Give civilian volunteers and local coordinators lightweight search-and-rescue coordination tools without replacing professional SAR systems.

- ✅ Operation and sector data model (`sar_*` tables namespaced off the plan-09 `events`/`operations` surface; migration `0009`; `modules/sar.py` + `routes/sar.py`: `GET/POST /sar/operations`, `GET /sar/operations/{id}`, `PATCH /sar/operations/{id}[/status]`; auto-grid or manual sectors; persons M2M; timestamp-guarded LWW like `/sync`).
- ✅ Operations UI with status board (`OperationsScreen.jsx` list + create flow with zone/auto-grid; `OperationDetailScreen.jsx` status board — linked persons, sectors grid, task checklist, checked-in volunteers, recent field reports; `'operations'` category-gated tab; trilingual es/en/pt).
- ✅ Sector assignment and task checklist (`SectorCard.jsx` claim/release/check-in/clear/needs-recheck; one-active-volunteer-per-sector conflict → HTTP 409; per-sector task CRUD; `auto_checkout_stale` sweep for stale claims).
- ✅ Field reports over the mesh (server `sar_field_reports` + `POST /sar/operations/{id}/field-reports` + `GET/POST /sar/sync` LWW; `FieldReportSheet.jsx` offline-queued; Android `RecordEnvelope.TYPE_FIELD_REPORT` transport + JVM round-trip test). 🚧 On-device Room persistence of relayed field reports rides the same pending Room-migration/BLE-certification path as plan-25's trust-column carry; the cloud/bridge path is fully working today.
- ✅ Volunteer check-in/check-out (`POST /sar/operations/{id}/join` idempotent + auto-subscribe, `/sar/sectors/{id}/checkin`, `/sar/volunteers/{id}/checkout`; sector flips `in_progress` on check-in).

**Shipped in this plan:** six additive `sar_*` tables (`sar_operations`/`sar_operation_persons`/`sar_sectors`/`sar_tasks`/`sar_volunteers`/`sar_field_reports`) + migration `0009`; `modules/sar.py` + `routes/sar.py` (operation CRUD, sector claim/release/status with 409 conflict, check-in/out, task checklist, field reports with `sighting`→`needs_recheck` / `cleared` side-effects, `found`→registry update gated on operator confirmation, `/sar/sync` mesh/cloud LWW); access model — public reads + volunteer actions, verified-account operation creation, operator-gated `found` confirmation, every mutation audit-logged; PWA `OperationsScreen`/`OperationDetailScreen`/`SectorCard`/`FieldReportSheet` + store/view wiring + DashboardScreen SAR widgets + trilingual i18n (629 shared keys); Android field-report mesh envelope transport; 13 server pytest + 5 frontend vitest. **Remaining:** on-device Room persistence + BLE propagation of field reports (rides the pending mesh certification in plan-16/18/23); ICS-201/CAP interop and invite-only operations are open questions deferred.

---

## Plan 27 — Data Quality & Deduplication Engine
**File:** [`plans/plan-27-data-quality-deduplication.md`](plans/plan-27-data-quality-deduplication.md)  
**Goal:** Keep the registry clean and accurate as records arrive from civilians, hospitals, OCR, SMS, and the mesh.

- ✅ Exact deduplication (cédula, phone+name): `normalize_cedula`/`normalize_phone`, `exact_clusters`, operator `auto_merge_exact` + `GET /duplicates/exact` (soft, audited, reversible).
- ✅ Fuzzy matching with confidence scoring: `modules/dedup.py` — Spanish/Portuguese phonetic key + Levenshtein + composite name/age/location/time scoring with reason codes; persisted `merge_candidates` table (migration 0010) + `/merge-candidates` scan/list/resolve.
- ✅ Human review queue for merge candidates: `MergeReviewModal.jsx` (side-by-side, matching-green/conflict-amber, confidence/reason chips, provenance) + DuplicatesScreen candidate queue; operator-gated resolve (merge / not-match / needs-info).
- ✅ Conflict resolution rules by source trust tier: field-level `resolve_conflicts` (official > self > web > witness > import > sms > ocr; newer wins on tie; losing values preserved) + `can_override_status` (found/deceased need a verified source).
- ✅ OCR and SMS cleanup pipeline: OCR/SMS drafts (already reviewed=0) auto-scan against the registry into the candidate queue on creation.
- 🚧 Mesh-aware merge propagation: `DedupNormalize.kt` (server-mirrored exact keys, 11 JVM tests) + `MeshRepository.localExactDuplicates`; cloud/mesh merge decisions converge via the existing `merged_into` LWW carry. APK builds/installs/tests green on both phones; on-device *visual* verification of the new PWA UI is blocked by a **pre-existing** React-vendor init-order (TDZ) white screen in the bundled WebView assets (reproduced on committed main, independent of plan-27).
- ✅ Registry health dashboard: `egi quality report` CLI + pending `merge_candidates` count in `/stats/global` and the operator DashboardScreen.

---

## Plan 27.5 — Volunteer Coordination, Facility Access & Building Inspections
**File:** [`plans/plan-27.5-volunteer-coordination-facility-access.md`](plans/plan-27.5-volunteer-coordination-facility-access.md)  
**Goal:** Let volunteers, facility staff, remote helpers, and family coordinate without rigid roles — a lightweight volunteer registry, intent-first home, hospital/shelter cross-checking, and building inspections, all reusing Plan 25 trust.

- ✅ Volunteer registry data model: `volunteer_profiles` (migration 0011), `modules/volunteers.py` + public `POST /volunteers/register`, `GET/PATCH /volunteers/me`, `GET /volunteers/nearby`, `GET /volunteers/sync` (availability/mobility/languages/skills, timestamp-guarded LWW); anonymous SAR join path unchanged.
- ✅ Intent-first home screen: three persisted intent cards (looking / help / facility) routing to focused defaults (search / operations / facility match) without hiding any feature; `chooseIntent` + es/en/pt/guc i18n.
- ✅ Role "hats" in SAR: `role` column on `sar_volunteers` (idempotent `_migrate_table_columns`), `VolunteerJoin.role` + `PATCH /sar/volunteers/{id}/role`; role picker / change-in-place / role chips in OperationDetailScreen + SectorCard (also fixed a latent non-existent-`active`-status volunteers filter).
- ✅ Facility watcher integration: `sar_facility_watch` (migration 0012), `facility_match` field-report type + verdicts (person_is_here / not_here / needs_verification), operator-gated `operations_near_facility` / `subscribe` / `facility-candidates` / `facility-match`; confirming a `person_is_here` updates the person via the existing resolve gate. New `FacilityMatchScreen` (pick facility → nearby ops → subscribe → one-tap verdicts).
- ✅ Building inspections: `building_inspection` field-report type + structured `checklist` column; unsafe/occupied/blocked/follow-up flags the sector `needs_recheck` on create and on mesh `sync_upload`; checklist form in `FieldReportSheet` + inspection/verdict badges on the operation status board; `building_inspection` added to `SAR_TASK_KINDS`.
- ✅ Location-aware suggestions: `lib/location.js` (`buildSuggestions` + quiet-hours-aware `isQuietHours`, reusing `directions.js` geolocation/haversine); the help intent + operations screen request one opt-in position fix, `LocationSuggestions` panel surfaces nearby operations/facilities on Home + Operations with a persisted hide toggle; works offline from cached lists; 6 new vitest.
- 🚧 On-device PWA visual verification of the new screens rides the same **pre-existing** WebView TDZ white screen tracked in plans 19/27 (no new native code this plan; the new report types relay over the existing `RecordEnvelope`/`merged_into` mesh carry).

## Plan 28 — Missing Animals (Pets)
**File:** [`plans/plan-28-missing-animals.md`](plans/plan-28-missing-animals.md)  
**Goal:** Add a separate registry for missing and found pets (dogs, cats, and other animals) that reuses the mesh but never mixes with missing-person data.

- ✅ Animal data model and server endpoints: `animals` table (migration 0013) + `AnimalRecord` (six animal statuses via CHECK + `VALID_ANIMAL_STATUSES`), `modules/animals.py` (timestamp-guarded LWW upsert, trust-gated public list, status patch) + `routes/animals.py` (`GET/POST /animals`, `GET /animals/{id}`, `PATCH /animals/{id}/status`); `/sync` carries an additive `animals` list both ways. Never mixed with persons (`record_type="animal"`).
- ✅ Android mesh support for animal records: `RecordEnvelope.TYPE_ANIMAL`, `AnimalEntity` + `AnimalDao` + `EgiDatabase` v3 (`MIGRATION_2_3`, schema `3.json`), animal mappers (hop_count carry), `MeshRepository.mergeAnimalEnvelope` (hop-limit + LWW + relay increment) gated by the `CATEGORY_ANIMALS` relay opt-out, `pendingAnimalsForCloud`/`applyCloudAnimals`, `CloudSyncClient` animals upload/download, `BluetoothMeshManager` wiring; `AnimalEnvelopeTest` (6 JVM round-trips). assembleDebug + unit tests green; installed + launched on Samsung SM-S134DL + Moto G Play 2023 (clean v2→v3 migration, healthy mesh in logcat; PWA visual render rides the pre-existing WebView TDZ).
- ✅ Animal report form, search, and detail UI: `AnimalsScreen` (filter chips, photo/emoji cards, "looking for a person?" note), `AnimalReportSheet` (species + all fields, offline-queued), `AnimalDetailScreen` ("I saw"/"I found" status, reveal-contact, verified badge, flag); store + `view.decorateAnimal`, AppShell/TabBar/Sidebar wiring, es/en/pt i18n.
- ✅ Shelter animal board: `animals.list_shelter_animals`/`add_shelter_animal` (source='shelter', reviewed=1), public `GET /shelters/{id}/animals` + writer-gated `POST`; `ShelterAnimalPanel` + "Animales" tab in `ShelterDetailScreen`; owners find a held pet via the public list.
- ✅ Animal-specific deduplication: `modules/animals_dedup.py` — animal-only (never crosses into persons), exact (microchip / reporter+name+species) + species-gated fuzzy (name/colour/marks/location/time) reusing the plan-27 phonetic + edit-distance primitives; operator-gated `GET /animals/duplicates`, `POST /animals/duplicates/{auto-merge-exact,merge,reject}`; soft, audited, reversible `merged_into` merge.
- ✅ User preferences to opt out of animal content/notifications/mesh forwarding: handled by the unified Plan 24 system — `animals` is a first-class category (display gates the tab + list, notify off by default through the generic server notification gate, mesh relay gated by `RELAY_CATEGORIES`/`CATEGORY_ANIMALS` on Android). `tests/animals.test.js` locks the display-off gating.
- ✅ Trust & safety (plan §Phase 6): owner contact stripped from public list/detail (`has_owner_contact` + rate-limited `POST /animals/{id}/contact` reveal, anti-scraping; mesh sync keeps full contact); flags action animal records (`resolve_flag` soft-deletes/approves via `reviewed`, `create_flag` dings the animal's origin device); verified badge + flag UI reusing a generalized `FlagModal`.
- ✅ README + in-app guidance: root + `docs/README.{en,es,pt}.md` "Missing Animals" sections (separate registry, same mesh); in-app `animals.notPersonNote` ("¿Buscas a una persona? Usa el formulario de personas.").

## Plan 29 — UX Audit & Pre-Flight Checks
**File:** [`plans/plan-29-ux-audit-and-preflight.md`](plans/plan-29-ux-audit-and-preflight.md)  
**Goal:** Run a systematic visual and UX audit as the final step before calling the product polished, then keep a lightweight pre-flight process for every release.

- 🚧 Screenshot baseline of every major screen (naming convention + device-lab process documented in `docs/ux-audit/baseline/README.md`; actual device captures deferred — on-device PWA render is blocked by the pre-existing WebView TDZ noted in plans 19/27/28).
- ✅ Automated accessibility checks (`tests/a11y.test.js` axe-style button-name/label rules gated in CI; `npm run ux:audit` WCAG contrast over tokens; opt-in `ux:lighthouse`/`ux:axe` scripts for the deeper network-dependent passes).
- ✅ Fix known issues: wordmark (uniform "EGI"), background color (neutral `#F8F9FA` token), shelter origin (location options, lat/lon demoted to advanced) — each with a regression test.
- 🚧 Design tokens and component audit (`frontend/src/styles/tokens.js` defined + adopted in Wordmark/Logo/ConnectionBanner/shell/auth/picker; broader per-screen tokenization is incremental because the UI styles inline per-screen rather than via shared primitives).
- ✅ Manual pre-flight checklist (`docs/ux-audit/PREFLIGHT_CHECKLIST.md`, linked from README + DEPLOYMENT; `findings-001.md` first round; in-app "Reportar un problema" + `USER_FEEDBACK_TEMPLATE.md` intake; CONTRIBUTING + CLAUDE.md UX-pre-flight notes).

**Why last:** UX polish should happen after the functional layers (mesh, trust, operations, data quality, animals) are stable, so the audit captures the real final product rather than screens that will change again.

## How to use this roadmap

1. Pick a plan file for the area you want to work on.
2. Implement the pending items in the suggested order.
3. Update the status emoji in this file (and the **Last updated** date and **At a glance** table) when a phase ships.
4. Add new plans (`plan-14-*.md`) when the project outgrows the current set.

## Cross-cutting priorities

These apply to every plan:

- **Privacy:** collect the minimum, mark unverified data, prefer corrections over silent deletion.
- **Interoperability:** keep records PFIF-aligned; import/export should round-trip.
- **Offline-first:** every feature should degrade gracefully without internet.
- **Test coverage:** new behavior needs a test; manual-only features need a checklist entry.
- **Spanish-first UI:** other languages are welcome, but the crisis context is Spanish-speaking.
